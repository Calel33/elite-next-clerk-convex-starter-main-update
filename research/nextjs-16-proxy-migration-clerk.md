# Next.js 16 Proxy Migration: Clerk Integration Research

**Status:** Monitoring  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Created:** December 18, 2025  
**Last Updated:** December 18, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Next.js 16 has deprecated the `middleware.ts` file convention in favor of `proxy.ts`. This research tracks Clerk's official guidance for migrating `clerkMiddleware()` to work with the new proxy pattern. Currently, Clerk's SDK **has not yet published** official Next.js 16 proxy migration documentation, and their current examples still use `middleware.ts`.

**Current State:**
- ✅ Our `middleware.ts` works perfectly with Next.js 16 (backward compatible)
- ⚠️ Deprecation warning appears but does not block functionality
- ❌ Clerk has not released `clerkProxy()` or proxy-specific guidance
- ✅ Security: All auth flows functional, no vulnerabilities introduced

**Recommendation:** **DEFER MIGRATION** until Clerk publishes official proxy migration guide.

## Research Findings (December 18, 2025)

### 1. Clerk's Current Documentation Status

**Sources Checked:**
- ✅ Clerk Next.js SDK Reference: https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware
- ✅ Clerk Next.js Quickstart: https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/getting-started/quickstart
- ✅ Clerk GitHub Repository: https://github.com/clerk/clerk-nextjs-app-quickstart
- ✅ Clerk Upgrade Guides: https://clerk.com/docs/upgrade-guides

**Key Findings:**

#### Current Pattern (Still Official as of Dec 2025)
```typescript
// middleware.ts - Still in Clerk's official examples
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)'])

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  if (isProtectedRoute(req)) await auth.protect()
})

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

**Status:** ✅ This pattern is used in ALL current Clerk documentation and examples as of December 2025.

#### Clerk SDK Version Compatibility
- **Current SDK:** `@clerk/nextjs@6.36.4` (as of our migration)
- **Next.js 16 Support:** ✅ Confirmed working with Next.js 16.1.0
- **Proxy Pattern Support:** ❌ Not yet documented or released

### 2. Next.js 16 Proxy Pattern (Official)

**Source:** https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy

#### Standard Proxy Pattern (Non-Auth)
```typescript
// proxy.ts
import { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export function proxy(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```

#### Key Changes from Middleware:
1. **File rename:** `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts`
2. **Function rename:** `middleware()` → `proxy()`
3. **Export change:** Named export `export function proxy()` instead of default export
4. **Semantic purpose:** Clarifies this is for network-level proxying/routing, not general middleware

### 3. The Challenge: Clerk's Wrapper Pattern

Clerk's `clerkMiddleware()` is a **higher-order function** that expects to be the default export and wraps your logic:

```typescript
// Current pattern
export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  // Your logic here
})
```

This doesn't directly translate to the new proxy pattern which expects:

```typescript
// New pattern
export function proxy(req) {
  // Logic here
}
```

**Potential Migration Approaches (Unverified):**

#### Option A: Wrapper Adaptation (Requires Clerk SDK Update)
```typescript
// proxy.ts - HYPOTHETICAL, not yet officially supported
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)'])

export function proxy(req) {
  // Clerk would need to provide a way to invoke their middleware within proxy
  return clerkMiddleware(async (auth, request) => {
    if (isProtectedRoute(request)) await auth.protect()
  })(req)
}
```

#### Option B: Clerk Proxy Function (Future SDK)
```typescript
// proxy.ts - HYPOTHETICAL
import { clerkProxy, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)'])

// Clerk might release a clerkProxy() that works with the new pattern
export function proxy(req) {
  return clerkProxy(async (auth) => {
    if (isProtectedRoute(req)) await auth.protect()
  })(req)
}
```

#### Option C: Manual Auth Check Pattern
```typescript
// proxy.ts - HYPOTHETICAL, manual auth checking
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function proxy(request) {
  const { userId } = await auth()
  
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {
    if (!userId) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/sign-in', request.url))
    }
  }
  
  return NextResponse.next()
}
```

**⚠️ WARNING:** None of these approaches are officially documented by Clerk. Do not implement without official guidance.

### 4. Community Discussion

**GitHub Discussion:** https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/84842

Key points from community:
- Next.js team confirms backward compatibility for `middleware.ts` in v16
- No timeline given for removing `middleware.ts` support
- Recommendation to wait for library authors (like Clerk) to update
- Some users report successfully using `middleware.ts` in production on Next.js 16

### 5. Backward Compatibility Timeline

**Official Next.js Position:**
- ✅ `middleware.ts` continues to work in Next.js 16.x
- ⚠️ Deprecation warning shown during build
- ❓ No announced removal date (likely Next.js 17 or 18)
- 📋 Codemod available: `npx @next/codemod@canary middleware-to-proxy .`

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Short-term (3-6 months):** ✅ Safe to keep `middleware.ts`
- **Medium-term (6-12 months):** ⚠️ Monitor for Next.js 17 announcements
- **Long-term (12+ months):** ⚠️ Likely need migration before Next.js 18

## Migration Blockers

### Primary Blocker: No Official Clerk Guidance

**Blocker:** Clerk has not published:
1. ❌ Official proxy pattern for `clerkMiddleware()`
2. ❌ Migration guide from `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`
3. ❌ SDK update with `clerkProxy()` or equivalent
4. ❌ Compatibility notes for Next.js 16 proxy pattern

**Impact:** Cannot safely migrate without risking auth functionality.

### Secondary Blocker: Clerk SDK Architecture

Clerk's current middleware design assumes:
- Default export pattern
- Higher-order function wrapping
- Access to Next.js request/response objects in specific format

These assumptions may need SDK-level changes to support the proxy pattern.

- [ ] Rename file: `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts`
- [ ] Update function signature per Clerk's guidance
- [ ] Update imports if needed (check for new exports)
- [ ] Verify `config.matcher` still works
- [ ] Test all auth flows:
  - [ ] Sign in
  - [ ] Sign up
  - [ ] Sign out
  - [ ] Protected route access (dashboard)
  - [ ] Public route access (landing page)
  - [ ] API route protection

### Post-Migration Verification
- [ ] Build succeeds without deprecation warnings
- [ ] Dev server runs without errors
- [ ] Production build deploys successfully

## Technical Debt & Dependencies

### Current State
```typescript
// middleware.ts (Current)
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)'])

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  if (isProtectedRoute(req)) await auth.protect()
})

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

**Dependencies:**
- `@clerk/nextjs`: `^6.36.4`
- `next`: `16.1.0`

**Status:** ✅ Fully functional, deprecated but supported

### Future State (Hypothetical)
```typescript
// proxy.ts (Future)
// Implementation TBD - waiting for Clerk guidance
import { /* TBD */ } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export function proxy(request) {
  // Implementation depends on Clerk's official pattern
}

export const config = {
  // Likely unchanged
}
```
